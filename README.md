# VPDetection
Honours Dissertation project

The practical side of this dissertation primarily looks at three edge based detection methods, looks at their results, compares to ground truth results and compares speed of completion.

The theoretical side of this dissertation focuses on different methods to calculate the vanishing point, it looks at what vanishing points are, how many there are, different methods to calculate where the vanishing point is (Texture based, Edge based and Learning based), different way to cluster results (Hierarchical clustering, JLinkage, etc) and different measurements of accuracy.
